## Download and Installation instructions on Ubuntu Linux

NextFOAM top directory is set as `/opt/OpenFOAM` for all users. Installation directories are followings:

| application | directory |
| --- | --- |
| NextFOAM-2405 | /opt/OpenFOAM/NextFOAM-2405 |
| ThirdParty-2405 | /opt/OpenFOAM/ThirdParty-2405 |

Install required packages for building NextFOAM-2405 in the Ubuntu Linux. Run commands as root:

```
apt-get -y update
apt-get install -y build-essential flex zlib1g-dev libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev texinfo cmake
```

Download `openmpi 4.0.5` source and install on `/opt/openmpi-4.0.5` directory
```
wget https://download.open-mpi.org/release/open-mpi/v4.0/openmpi-4.0.5.tar.gz
tar zxf openmpi-4.0.5.tar.gz
rm openmpi-4.0.5.tar.gz
cd openmpi-4.0.5
./configure --prefix=/opt/openmpi-4.0.5
make -j 4 all
make install
echo 'export PATH=/opt/openmpi-4.0.5/bin:$PATH' >> /etc/bash.bashrc
```
Clone `nextfoam-cfd` and move to the top directory

```
mkdir -p /opt/OpenFOAM
git clone https://github.com/nextfoam/nextfoam-cfd.git
mv nextfoam-cfd/NextFOAM-2405 /opt/OpenFOAM
mv nextfoam-cfd/ThirdParty-2405 /opt/OpenFOAM
```

Setup the environment variables in the `/opt/OpenFOAM/NextFOAM-2405/etc/bashrc`
```
vi /opt/OpenFOAM/NextFOAM-2405/etc/bashrc

export WM_PROJECT_VERSION=2405
projectDir="/opt/OpenFOAM/NextFOAM-$WM_PROJECT_VERSION"
```

**(Note)** When running `decomposePar` command, the no scotch library error is shown, download `SCOTCH-6.1.0` and set this version in the `etc/config.sh/scotch`
```
cd /opt/OpenFOAM/ThirdParty-2405
wget https://sources.easybuild.io/s/SCOTCH/scotch_6.1.0.tar.gz
tar zxf scotch_6.1.0.tar.gz

vi /opt/OpenFOAM/NextFOAM-2405/etc/config.sh/scotch

SCOTCH_VERSION=scotch_6.1.0
```

Compile NextFOAM-2405.

**(Note)** If you install NextFOAM-2405 on Ubuntu 22.04, you should install `gcc-9` and `g++-9` and set `gcc-9` as the compiler. 

```
apt install gcc-9 g++-9
export WM_COMPILE_CONTROL="version=9"
echo 'export WM_COMPILE_CONTROL="version=9"' >> /etc/bash.bashrc
```

```
source /opt/OpenFOAM/NextFOAM-2405/etc/bashrc
cd /opt/OpenFOAM/NextFOAM-2405
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$WM_THIRD_PARTY_DIR/platforms/linux64Gcc/fftw-3.3.10/lib
./Allwmake -j
```

Enable the environment variables at start time
```
echo 'source /opt/OpenFOAM/NextFOAM-2405/etc/bashrc' >> /etc/bash.bashrc
```
